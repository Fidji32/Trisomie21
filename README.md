# ðŸª™ Trisomie 21 Haute-Garonne

Realization of an application in team of 3 especially conceived for the association "Trisomie 21 Haute-Garonne" during my graduate studies. In this project, I was mainly in charge of the PHP back-end and the database. 

This application digitizes the [token-saving system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_economy) used to help children with trisomy 21 managed by the association. It enables them to follow their progress within the association, the classrooms and the home, to help them integrate into society.

Here are two examples of the application's design, highlighting the child's achievement of a goal and then a "failure".
